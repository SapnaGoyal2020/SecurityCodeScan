### SCS0012 - Weak ECB Mode
ECB mode will produce the same result for identical blocks (ie: 16 bytes for AES). An attacker could be able to guess the encrypted message. The use of AES in CBC mode with a HMAC is recommended guaranteeing integrity and confidentiality.
#### Risk
The ECB mode will produce identical encrypted block for equivalent plain text block. This could allow an attacker that is eavesdropping to guess the content sent. This same property can also allow the recovery of the original message. Furthermore, this cipher mode alone does not guarantee integrity.
#### Vulnerable Code
```cs
using (var aes = new AesManaged {
    KeySize = KeyBitSize,
    BlockSize = BlockBitSize,
    Mode = CipherMode.ECB, // !!!
    Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7
})
{
    //Use random IV
    aes.GenerateIV();
    iv = aes.IV;
    using (var encrypter = aes.CreateEncryptor(cryptKey, iv))
    using (var cipherStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        using (var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(cipherStream, encrypter, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
        using (var binaryWriter = new BinaryWriter(cryptoStream))
        {
            //Encrypt Data
            binaryWriter.Write(secretMessage);
        }
        cipherText = cipherStream.ToArray();
    }
}
//No HMAC suffix to check integrity!!!
```
#### Solution
Use some other mode, but notice that CBC without authenticated integrity check is vulnerable to another type of attack. For an example of authenticated integrity check see the [Solution in Weak Cipher Mode](#SCS0013).
