### SCS0008 - Cookie Without SSL Flag
It is recommended to specify the Secure flag to new cookie.
#### Risk
The Secure flag is a directive to the browser to make sure that the cookie is not sent by unencrypted channel
#### Vulnerable Code
The `requireSSL` value is explicitly set to `false` or the default is left.
```xml
<httpCookies requireSSL="false" [..] />
```
```cs
// default is left
var cookie = new HttpCookie("test");
// or explicitly set to false
var cookie = new HttpCookie("test");
cookie.Secure = false;
```
#### Solution
```xml
<httpCookies requireSSL="true" [..] />
```
```cs
var cookie = new HttpCookie("test");
cookie.Secure = true; //Add this flag
cookie.HttpOnly = true;
```
